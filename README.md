Sniper Client for Japan Deputy Shopping Services
==============

This client will eventually add sniper capabilities (bidding right before the auction ends instead of exposing your bid early) for the deputy services that do not provide sniping services.
Another possible feature is to watch the price of a store (not auction) item and auto-buy below a threshold.

I am writing this client so that I can snipe auctions using the Remambo deputy service, which differs from other services by offering upfront charges and a two month storage period (twice as long as usual).

## Implementation Details
Http requests execute asynchronously using `Future`s and the `Spray` library. Clients are composed of mixin `trait`s.
